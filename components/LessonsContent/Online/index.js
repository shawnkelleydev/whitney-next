      <p>
        I offer a limited number of weekly live Skype lessons for intermediate
        and advanced students who are unable to attend lessons at any of my
        studio locations.
      </p>
      <p>Requirements for Skype lessons:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A quiet, well-lit space with good internet access during your lesson
          time
        </li>
        <li>
          A webcam with a good built-in microphone, built in or external (please
          contact me for recommendations) that can be set up so that I can see
          your full upper body
        </li>
        <li>A large screen (no phones!) so that you can see me clearly.</li>
        <li>A music stand</li>
        <li>
          A metronome and tuner (there are many phone apps that can work for
          this; please ask for recommendations if you do not already have them)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Recommended Equipment (these are not required but will help your lesson
        experience):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Extrenal microphone</li>
        <li>External speakers</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Please contact me about available times, and rates. Students are also
        encouraged to sign up for one in-person lesson at any of my studio
        locations each month to receive more hands-on instruction (which will
        balance out this limitation in online lessons).
